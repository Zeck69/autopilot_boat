# Designing the Boat

## 1)   Naive design and guidelines for the boat

To build this boat, we needed to define clear guidelines that we had to follow to design our boat, as well as all the challenges we had to undertake. First of all, the major difficulties we had with this project come from the fact we will be using it in a marine/lake environnement. We thus had to think about :

1. &nbsp; <img src="assets/floatting.png" alt="floating" style="width:50px;"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flotation and Balance {: .fs-6 .fw-500 .text-center}
2. &nbsp;<img src="assets/tiller.png" alt="floating" style="width:50px;"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ability to Move Sail and Rudder {: .fs-6 .fw-500 .text-center}
3. &nbsp;<img src="assets/servo.png" alt="floating" style="width:50px;"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space for Components {: .fs-6 .fw-500 .text-center}
4. &nbsp;<img src="assets/watter.png" alt="floating" style="width:50px;"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watertightness for our Components {: .fs-6 .fw-500 .text-center}

### Flotation and Balance
The first step to make a boat is to do something that **floats**. As our project is roughly a small prototype on wich we tried to experiment automation, we based our calculation on simple principles like **Archimede's principle**. With the design given in the repository, we can have **2.5 kg of mass in total**, boat included. This is well enough, as the major source of weight in our boat is the boat itself. The rest of the components only weight 400g.

***

The **balance** of the boat is as much important as the previous consideration. There are three important parts of the boat that will influence its balance :
- The **spread of our components across the boat**
  - Our components aren't that heavy so the balance was not hard to find.
  - However, the biggest components - the battery - was placed as close as possible to the center of the boat.
  - ==> It does not cause much problem to have a boat leaning on its rear, as long as it is not close to sink. What should be seek is a lateral balance and avoiding to lean on the front.
- The ***dagger-board*** wich is mandatory, otherwise the boat would drift in the same direction as the wind instead of moving forward. It also helps stabilize the boat as its bearing capacity when moving creates a moment that keeps the boat upright.
- The ***keel*** might be the most precious ally for balance. Epecially when the mast is high and heavy, the keel plays the role of a counterweight creating a moment that prevent the boat from tilting on the side.

### Space for components


### Watertightness for our components
