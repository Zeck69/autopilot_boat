# Sensors

<div style="text-align: justify"> Sensors are essential to the design of our boat to analyse the wind direction, the speed of the boat and it's location. Here are the tools we used : 

## GPS 
  
<div style="text-align: justify"> A GPS allows us to measure time, location and speed. We wanted to use it to calculate the average speed of our boat to optimise the angle of our sail. Furthermore, we wanted to use the location to allow our boat to follow a trajectory independently. Unfortunately, we were not able to get our hands on a working GPS so could not implement these features with it. But we do recommend using one for the reasons above ! If you have the opportunity to get one, we recommend using the TinyGPS++ library created by Arduiniana which is very easy to use and beginner friendly. </div>

As a plan B, we have decided to use the IMUâ€™s accelerometer and gyroscope to get the same, albeit less precise, information.
